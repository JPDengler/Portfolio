    "whois": "* Hi, I'm Joey! *\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAn Automation Technician with software development experience, specializing in troubleshooting, maintaining, and optimizing industrial automation systems. I currently work at Bridor USA, where I handle PLC programming (Siemens & Allen-Bradley), servo drive configuration, safety relays, industrial sensors, and electrical diagnostics within high-speed production environments. I am also developing an internal admin dashboard to streamline access to documentation, inventory, and work history.\n\nI am completing my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering at Southern New Hampshire University, graduating March 1st, 2025. Throughout my studies, I have maintained a 4.0 GPA, earning distinctions such as Alpha Sigma Lambda, Dean’s List, President’s List, and Honor Roll. My academic experience has strengthened my problem-solving skills, bridging software development and automation technology.\n\nMy technical expertise spans C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and MySQL, with experience in logic programming, embedded systems, and industrial automation scripting. Beyond my professional work, I have contributed to various software and hardware projects, including \"Project Magpie\" (this portfolio), mock app prototypes, and IoT projects like \"Project BMO,\" a voice-interactive robot using Raspberry Pi and OpenAI.",
